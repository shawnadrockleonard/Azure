# Azure Web App Virtual Network

The Azure App Web with a Virtual Network hybrid connection enables connectivity from an PaaS Azure Web App to Virtual Network resources.

The other version enables integration with VNets in other regions or with Classic VNets. This version of the feature requires deployment of a Virtual Network Gateway into your VNet. This is the point-to-site VPN-based feature and is only supported with Windows apps..

To learn more about Web Apps refer to [Introduction to the App Service Environments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/web-sites-integrate-with-vnet) documentation.

This template allows you to create a Web App in a Multi-Tenant system supporting full range capability to Virtual Network environment resources.
